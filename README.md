# Dash

## What is this for?

`Dash` is a OSX setup and management tool forked from IFTTT/dash.
Install homebrew and ansible. and run ansible-playbook.

## TL;DR

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trkw/dash/main/bin/bootstrap)"

## Recommend

Export "your" dotfiles repository URL to \$DOTFILES_URL before running the bootstrap script.  
bootstrap script pull to `~/dotfiles`. and if you make `osx/playbook.yml` and `osx/Brewfile` file, playbook load it and run.

    export DOTFILES_URL=https://github.com/trkw/dotfiles  #example
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trkw/dash/main/bin/bootstrap)"

## Step-By-Step Setup

### Run the bootstrap script

This script will install the following:

- Homebrew with XCode Command Line Tools
- Ansible
- git clone this repository `~/.dash`
- (Optional)git clone dotfiles repository `~/dotfiles`

And run ansible-playbook [`~/.dash/ansible/mac.yml`](https://github.com/trkw/dash/blob/main/ansible/mac.yml)

- ~/.dash/ansible/mac.yml
  - Update Homebrew, ansible
  - Install or Update homebrew/cask, homebrew/bundle, mas-cli/mas
  - (Optional)run ansible-playbook.
    - ~/dotfiles/osx/playbook.yml (if exists)
  - (Optional)Install OSX apps by [homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)
    - ~/dotfiles/osx/Brewfile (if exists)

It should run idempotently, meaning you should be able to run it as many times as you want and it won't hurt anything. If it fails due to a temporary condition (like network issues), running it again should pick up where it left off. If new items are added to the script, running it against a functioning environment should only add the new things.

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trkw/dash/main/bin/bootstrap)"
